"""Deterministic quality heuristics.

The critic needs both signal types. Structural smells ("this process has 14
stages", "this Stage cites 19 Concepts") are mechanical and belong in code; the
critic prompt covers judgment calls.

Whether a Stage carries an example or an implementation detail is also
mechanical, so it lives here rather than in the critic prompt. Asking a model
to grade its own output on "did I write an example" produces agreement, not a
signal: the model reads its own Stage, decides it is sufficiently illustrated,
and the gap survives. `app.domain.quality` decides it instead, from the artifact.

Warnings never fail a run on their own, except where a later publish gate makes
them blocking for new candidates.
