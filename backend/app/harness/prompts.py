Task: enrich each Stage of one Main Process.

For every Stage produce:
- local goal,
- why it exists,
- local outcome,
- dependency notes,
- candidate Concepts and Operations (names only at this stage),
- implementation detail candidates,
- an example candidate,
- evidence references where available.

Granularity guard: a Stage must be expressible as "Complete X to obtain Y".
Do not repeat implementation detail in the title.

{STAGE_GUIDANCE}

Follow the unchanged process `teaching_plan` across batches. Enrich only
`current_batch_stage_keys`, using `current_batch_plan` as the exact slice of
that plan, never starting a new route or changing the running case. Earlier
`prior_planned_outputs` and `prior_stage_context` are planned/authored material,
not evidence that a learner has done the work or that an example was executed.
If the plan status is `legacy_absent_unverified`, no plan was supplied: do not
claim the route's instructional coherence was verified or invent a missing plan.

Realize the plan in existing COP fields, not hidden planning/teaching extras:
- `why_it_exists`: answer the learning question, why this comes now, what earlier
  result it builds on, and why each candidate Concept is needed for this reasoning.
- `example_candidate`: develop the same running case; separate observation from
  inference, explain the warrant linking them, test a plausible alternative, and
  state the limits of the conclusion. A model or abstraction is not reality.
- implementation `action`, `expected_result`, and `caution`: guide the planned
  reasoning_moves and check_focus; explain what the evidence rules in/out and
  what would force revision. Include the remaining next_gap and transition
  evidence in `why_it_exists`, example `note`, or method descriptions so the next
  Stage has a justified input, not a mysterious leap.
Choose Concepts by explanatory need, never by a fixed quota. Keyword matches,
labels, and an apparently correct output alone do not demonstrate understanding.
Use non-code comparisons, predictions, explanations or decisions for non-code
learning tasks. Do not replace reasoning with shell/grep or keyword-count checks
unless using that tool is genuinely part of the requested learning task.

Two things are mandatory for every Stage, not optional enrichment. A reader who
has neither cannot act, which defeats the purpose of the Main Process.

1. `example_candidate` -- required for every Stage. Show the real thing:
   `summary` says what was done, `input` what went in, `output` what came out.
   An example that only restates the Stage title is not an example.

2. `implementation_detail_candidates` -- required for every Stage that lists
   Operation candidates. Each entry is one followable step:
   - `title`: what this step is, in a few words
   - `action`: what the reader does, in their own environment
    - `command`: literal command, code, or configuration only when the task needs it
    - `expected_result`: observable result and how to interpret it, not just a label
   - `caution`: the mistake a beginner makes here, and what it looks like

For a software Stage that installs, sets up, or configures something, `command` and
`expected_result` are both required. A setup Stage without a runnable command
leaves the reader stuck at step one, and a setup Stage without an expected
result leaves them unable to tell whether it worked.

Detail-density target for `{detail_density}`: around {limits["max_details"]}
implementation details per Stage, with around {limits["max_commands"]} commands
where useful. These are planning targets, not a hard ceiling on required steps.
Never omit prerequisite explanations, complete configuration, input-value
provenance, causal reasoning, checks, or recovery merely to hit a count.
Compact means less optional repetition, not missing logic. Detailed means more
explanation and worked examples, not more jargon or an inflated goal count.

Cite at `{evidence_density}` density: at most {refs["max_refs"]} evidence ref(s)
per Stage, covering {refs["scope"]}. Use only source ids present in the material
above; never invent one.

Concept promotion test: promote when misunderstanding it would break the mental
model, when it is reused across stages, or when it is a stable object category.

Concept quality contract (these are rejected mechanically, not by a reviewer):
- `definition` must explain what the thing is in plain language. It must not be
  empty, a placeholder, or a restatement of `name`.
- `role` must say which part of the route depends on it.
- Every Concept you emit must be bound to at least one Stage in `stage_bindings`,
  or be acted on by an Operation. Do not emit glossary-only entries.
Do not satisfy these by padding with words; a longer restatement of the name is
still circular.

Operation promotion test: promote when it changes or connects Concepts in a
meaningful way, is useful across implementations, and sits above raw API syntax.

Task: apply critic corrections conservatively.

Rules:
- repair only the entities named in the issues, and only the field each issue
  is about; an entity with no issue must come back unchanged,
- prefer local corrections over rewriting the artifact,
- never rewrite a locked (user-authored) path,
- never expand merely to increase coverage,
- preserve the main line and valid IDs.

{STAGE_GUIDANCE}

For `SETUP_NOT_ACTIONABLE` and `MISSING_VALIDATION_STEP` on a software task that
needs executable actions, name a real command a reader can run and a real result
they can inspect. A generic sentence satisfies neither. For a non-code task,
repair the concrete comparison, prediction, decision or explanation and its
observable check instead; never insert shell/grep or keyword checks as a
substitute for understanding.

Return one revision per changed field, naming entity_type, entity_key, field,
and the new value.

Return JSON matching the provided schema. Respond in {language}.
