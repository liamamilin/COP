"""Operational completeness: is this COP actually usable by a learner?

Three levels, separated because they fail for different reasons and because
"the JSON is legal" has been mistaken for "the product works" too often here:

    L1 structural   the JSON is a valid COP and every reference resolves.
    L2 operational  a reader can act on it: every Stage has an example, every
                    executable Stage says how to do the thing, and setup Stages
                    say how to verify it worked.
    L3 learnable    the loop closes: Minimal Practice, checkpoint questions,
                    and somewhere to go next.

The reference LangChain artifact passed the JSON Schema check for its entire
life while telling a reader nothing executable: 22 Stages, 0 examples, 0
implementation details, 12 Operations with no failure modes. A schema
validator cannot see that, because all of it is legal.

Every issue carries a stable `code`, the exact `entity_ref` it belongs to, and
a `recommended_change`. Stable codes matter because they are the contract the
critic, the refiner, the publish gate, and the tests all speak; free-text
critic output cannot be asserted on.

`known_source_ids` is optional on purpose. A caller holding the project's
sources passes them and gets orphan-reference detection; a caller that has no
idea what sources exist (a unit test on a bare fixture) gets everything else
rather than a flood of false "unresolvable" reports.
