/**
 * E2E runs against the real Compose stack, not a mock.
 *
 * The behaviour worth protecting here cannot be observed in a unit test: it
 * lives in the interaction between the client component, the JSONB draft row,
 * and the validation the API re-runs on every write. A fake fetch would assert
 * only that the fake was called.
 *
 * The suite talks to a throwaway database seeded by `globalSetup`, for the same
 * reason `make test` does: these tests truncate tables, and pointing them at
 * the development database would delete real projects.
 *
 * Start the stack first (`POSTGRES_HOST_PORT=55432 docker compose up -d`), or
 * set E2E_BASE_URL when the app is already listening elsewhere.
